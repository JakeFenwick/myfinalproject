***Web interface interest calculator***

Hello and welcome to my interest calculator!

***SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND REQUIREMENTS***

The requirements for development of this project are as listed:

*Intellij
*JDK of 16+
*Maven
*Springboot
*Thymeleaf
*H2 database, css, html
*JUnit testing

***PURPOSE OF MICROSERVICE***

The main purpose of my microservice is to allow any user/customer
easy access to get interest rate details:such as monthly,
yearly payments , total amount of interest paid per year
and over the whole loan term. This will allow users to
compare their personal rates/ other business rates to help
ensure the user is getting a good deal. The target audience
is anybody who wants to get loan information.

***FEATURES***

My microservice implements some basic features such as:

*Displaying a welcome message "Welcome to my interest calculator".

*Displaying an interactive table which users put in required information.

*Using java for math formula to compute interest.

*The user information will be saved to a H2 database for future reference

***Implementation plan***

   *PLANNED NOT FINAl*

1. Created a repository online using GitHub
2.  I started my microservice using springIO web initilizer
3. Imported SpringIO into Intellij IDE
4. Checked Maven was running correctly
5. Created controller, model, repository and service files.
6. Added in customer information under the model as well as interest information.

*** To come soon***

As project is not fully complete , my final plan was to use springboot to wire together
all my services and have a working webpage in which the interest calculator would
display and compute the users results.
